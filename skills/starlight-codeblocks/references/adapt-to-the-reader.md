# Adapt to the reader

Two features let the reader change what a block shows.

- If the same task comes in versions and each version is one code block, use the code switcher.
- If a version needs prose, a list or more than one code block, use the `<Tabs>` component of Starlight in an MDX file.
- If the page is a `.md` file, use the code switcher, or change the file to `.mdx` for `<Tabs>`.
- If only a value differs for each reader, such as a token or an ID, use fill-in placeholders in one block.

## Code switcher

Docs: https://ewels.github.io/starlight-codeblocks/features/code-switcher/

Guide: https://ewels.github.io/starlight-codeblocks/guides/code-switcher-or-tabs/

Use for install commands for each package manager, or one example in several languages. The variants become one block with a menu in the title bar. The block takes no more space than a plain block.

| Syntax | Where |
|---|---|
| `:::code-switcher` ... `:::` | Around two or more code blocks. No space after the colons. |
| `sync="<key>"` | After `:::code-switcher`, in braces |
| `label="<text>"` | Fence line of each variant |

````md
:::code-switcher{sync="pm"}
```sh label="npm"
npm install starlight-codeblocks
```
```sh label="pnpm"
pnpm add starlight-codeblocks
```
:::
````

- The directive can contain only code blocks. A paragraph inside it fails the build.
- A variant with no `label` shows the name of its language, such as "Python" for `py`. Two variants with the same label fail the build: `sh` and `bash` both show "Shell", so give each one a `label`.
- Each variant keeps its own attributes. The title bar shows the `title` of the variant that shows.
- Blocks with the same `sync` key switch together, matched by exact label text. The browser keeps the choice in `localStorage`, so it applies across the site. Give every package manager block the same key, such as `pm`.
- The copy button copies the variant that shows. Without JavaScript, the first variant shows.
- `sync` and the `syncKey` of `<Tabs>` are separate, and do not switch together.
- Option: with `codeSwitcher: false`, each block in the directive renders on its own, and the directive lines do not show.
- Limits: works in `.md` and `.mdx` files, not in Markdoc and not around a `<Code>` component. Needs Starlight.

## Fill-in placeholders

Docs: https://ewels.github.io/starlight-codeblocks/features/fill-in-placeholders/

Use for values that each reader must change, such as `YOUR_TOKEN` or `WORKSPACE_ID`. Each match becomes a field. What a reader types fills every field with the same text on the site, and the copied code. Do not use for alternatives that change more than a value: use the code switcher.

| Syntax | Where |
|---|---|
| `placeholder="<A>,<B>"` | Fence line: the literal texts, separated by commas |

````md
```sh placeholder="YOUR_TOKEN,WORKSPACE_ID"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/workspaces/WORKSPACE_ID/runs
```
````

- Every match of each text becomes a field. Choose texts that appear nowhere else in the block.
- The copy button, playgrounds and the **Run in browser** button get the reader's values. An empty field copies its placeholder text.
- A text that is not in the code gives a build warning.
- Option: `placeholders.storage` is `'local'` (default, kept across visits), `'session'` (until the tab closes) or `'none'`. Use `'session'` on a site where readers type secrets, and tell readers where the values go.
- Limits: literal text only. Without JavaScript, fields are plain inputs that do not update each other.
